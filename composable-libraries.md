## There are many ways to interface with Python

- SWIG
- F2PY
- Boost
- PyBind11
- Cython
- CFFI

---

## Motivations for interfacing with Python

- Fast and easy prototyping
- Leveraging Python packages
- Distribute via PyPI
- Test with pytest
- Simple I/O (e.g. parse input with a one-liner)

---

## CFFI example


---

## How to include libraries in larger projects

- Submodules
- Subtrees
- Download/link at build time

---

## If you rewrite the entire code (even in a new language), can you distribute the new code?

## Clean room design (AKA Chinese wall technique)

- Team A studies the code
- Team B never sees the code
- Team A explains the implementation to team B (specifications are validated by lawyers)
- Team B implements the algorithm based on the specs


### Everything that is not fair use or clean room design is derivative work

- Consider this when using or distributing code
- Consider this when choosing a license
- Choose a standard license
